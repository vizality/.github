# Farewell, Vizality

This announcement is long overdue, but Vizality as a Discord client mod is officially finished.

The project has been inactive for a couple of years now, but I never made an official statement until today.

Thank you to everyone who contributed, followed along, or supported Vizality while it was active. What started as a small idea turned into something much bigger than I ever expected, and that only happened because of the community around it.

There was a lot of time, effort, hardship, and yes, some drama along the way, especially early on. In the end, the constant effort required to keep up with Discord’s frequent client updates slowly drained the motivation to continue. Eventually, the project reached a natural stopping point.

At this point, Vizality should be considered permanently discontinued.

To keep everything accessible, all repositories have now been made public and archived. Nothing is being removed. The code will stay available for anyone who wants to learn from it or explore it, but no further development or support should be expected.

I am truly grateful to everyone who was part of this journey. Vizality was an important chapter for me, and I am proud of what we built together.

Thank you for being here.
